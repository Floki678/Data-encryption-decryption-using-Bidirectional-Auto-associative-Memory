# Data encryption decryption using Bidirectional Auto-associative Memory

Using BAM nets to encrypt and decrypt data on either side without transferring any key, but an integer value. Using pattern storing and evaluation technique to calculate the key vector. A very dynamic approach as the key value changes for each line of data.
